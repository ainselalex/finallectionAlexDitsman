        <h2 class="page2-title">Order of Assassins</h2>
        <p class="page2-par">
          The Assassins (Arabic: أساسِيّون‎, romanized: Asāsiyyūn) were a Nizari
          Isma'ili sect of Shia Islam who lived in the mountains of Persia and
          in Syria between 1090 and 1275. During that time, they held a strict
          subterfuge policy throughout the Middle East through the covert murder
          of first Muslim and later Christian leaders who were considered
          enemies of their state. The modern term assassination is based on the
          tactics used by the Assassins.
        </p>
        <p class="page2-par">
          Nizari Isma'ilism formed in the late 11th century after a succession
          crisis within the Fatimid Caliphate between Nizar ibn al-Mustansir and
          his half-brother, caliph al-Musta'li. Contemporaneous historians
          include Arabs ibn al-Qalanisi and Ali ibn al-Athir and the Persian
          Ata-Malik Juvayni. The first two referred to the Assassins as
          batiniyya, an epithet widely accepted by Isma'ilis themselves.
        </p>
        <h3 class="page2-title2">Overview</h3>
        <p class="page2-par2">
          The Nizari Isma'ili State, later known as the Assassins, was founded
          by Hassan-i Sabbah. The state was formed in 1090 after the capture of
          Alamut Castle in modern Iran, which served as the Assassins'
          headquarters. The Alamut and Lambsar castles became the foundation of
          a network of Isma'ili fortresses throughout Persia and Syria that
          formed the backbone of Assassin power, and included Syrian strongholds
          at Masyaf, Abu Qubays, al-Qadmus and al-Kahf. The Nizari Isma'ili
          State was ruled by Hassan-i Sabbath until his death in 1124. The
          Western world was introduced to the Assassins by the works of Marco
          Polo who understood the name as deriving from the term hashish.
        </p>
        <p class="page2-par2">
          The rulers of the Nizari Isma'ili State were religious leaders, at
          first da'i and later Imams. Prominent Assassin leaders operating in
          Syria included al-Hakim al-Munajjim, the physician-astrologer (d.
          1103), Abu Tahir al-Sa’igh, the goldsmith (d. 1113), Bahram al-Da'i
          (d. 1127), and Rashid ad-Din Sinan, renowned as the greatest Assassin
          chief (d. 1193).
        </p>
        <p class="page2-par2">
          While Assassins typically refers to the entire sect, only a group of
          disciples known as the fida'i actually engaged in conflict. Lacking
          their own army, the Nizari relied on these warriors to carry out
          espionage and assassinations of key enemy figures. The preferred
          method of killing was by dagger, never poison or arrows. The Assassins
          posed a substantial strategic threat to Fatimid, Abbasid, and Seljuk
          authority. Over the course of nearly 300 years, they killed hundreds -
          including three caliphs, a ruler of Jerusalem and several Muslim and
          Christian leaders. The first instance of murder in the effort to
          establish a Nizari Isma'ili state in Persia was the assassination of
          Seljuk vizier Nizam al-Mulk in 1092. Other notable victims of the
          Assassins include Janah ad-Dawla, emir of Homs, (1103), Mawdud ibn
          Altuntash, atabeg of Mosul (1113), Fatimid vizier Al-Afdal Shahanshah
          (1121), Seljuk atabeg Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi (1126), Fatimid caliph
          al-Amir bi-Ahkami’l-Lah (1130), Taj al-Mulk Buri, atabeg of Damascus
          (1132), and Abbasid caliphs al-Mustarshid (1135) and ar-Rashid (1138).
          Saladin, a major foe of the Assassins, escaped assassination twice
          (1175-1176). The first Frank known to have been killed by the
          Assassins was Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, in 1152. The Assassins
          were acknowledged and feared by the Crusaders, losing the de facto
          King of Jerusalem, Conrad of Montferrat, to an Assassin's blade in
          1192 and Lord Philip of Montfort of Tyre in 1270.
        </p>
        <p class="page2-par2">
          During the rule of Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah, the Nizari Isma'ili
          State declined internally, and was eventually destroyed as Khurshah
          surrendered the castles after the Mongol invasion of Persia. Khurshah
          died in 1256 and, by 1275, the Mongols had destroyed and eliminated
          the order of Assassins.
        </p>
        <p class="page2-par2">
          Accounts of the Assassins were preserved within Western, Arabic,
          Syriac, and Persian sources where they are depicted as trained
          killers, responsible for the systematic elimination of opposing
          figures. European orientalists in the 19th and 20th centuries also
          referred to the Isma'ili Assassins in their works, writing about them
          based on accounts in seminal works by medieval Sunni Arab and Persian
          authors, particularly ibn al-Qalanisi's Mudhayyal Ta'rikh Dimashq
          (Continuation of the Chronicle of Damascus), ibn al-Athir's al-Kāmil
          fit-Tārīkh (The Complete History), and Juvayni's Tarīkh-i Jahān-gushā
          (History of the World Conqueror).

          <h3 class="map-title">Origins</h3>
          <p class="map-paragraph">
            Hassan-i Sabbah was born in Qom, ca. 1050, and did his religious
            studies in Cairo with the Fatimids. Sabbah's father was a Qahtanite
            Arab, said to be a descendant of Himyaritic kings, having emigrated
            to Qom from Kufa. His support of Nizar ibn al-Mustansir in the
            succession crisis resulted in his imprisonment and deportation. He
            made his way to Persia where, through subterfuge, he and his
            followers captured Alamut Castle in 1090. This was the beginning of
            the Nizari Isma'ili State and the Assassins. Hassan-i Sabbah was not
            a direct descendant of Nizar and so a da'i rather than an Imam. It
            was Isma'ili doctrine that he kept Nizar's lineage intact through
            the so-called "concealed Imams". Sabbah adapted the fortress to suit
            his needs not only for defense from hostile forces, but also for
            indoctrination of his followers. After laying claim to the fortress
            at Alamut, Sabbah began expanding his influence outwards to nearby
            towns and districts, using his agents to gain political favour and
            to intimidate the local populations. Spending most of his days at
            Alamut producing religious works and developing doctrines for his
            order, Sabbah would never again leave his fortress. Murder for
            religious purposes was not new to the region, as the strangler sects
            of southern Iraq dating to the eighth century have shown. The
            strangler sects were stopped by the Umayyads; the Assassins would
            not be by the later caliphates.
          </p>
          <p class="map-paragraph">
            Shortly after establishing their headquarters at Alamut Castle, the
            sect captured Lambsar Castle, to be the largest of the Isma'ili
            fortresses and confirming the Assassins' power in northern Persia.
            The estimated date of the capture of Lambsar varies between 1096 and
            1102. The castle was taken under the command of Kiya Buzurg Ummid,
            later Sabbah's successor, who remained commandant of the fortress
            for twenty years. No interactions between the Christian forces of
            the First Crusade and the Assassins have been noted, with the latter
            concentrating on the Muslim enemies of the former. Other than a
            mention of Tancred's 1106 taking of Apamea (see below) in Gesta
            Tancredi, Western Europe likely first learned of the Assassins from
            the chronicles of William of Tyre, A History of Deeds Done Beyond
            the Sea, published much later. William coined the phrase "Old Man of
            the Mountain" to describe the Nizari Isma'ili da'i at Alamut.
          </p>
          <p class="map-paragraph">
            The Assassins were immediately threatened by the forces of Seljuk
            sultan Malik-Shah I, marking the beginning of the Nizari-Seljuk
            wars. One of Sabbah's disciples named Dihdar Bu-Ali from Qazvin
            rallied local supporters to deflect the Seljuks. Their attack on
            Alamut Castle and surrounding areas was canceled upon the death of
            the sultan. The new sultan Barkiyaruq, son of Malik-Shah I, did not
            continue the direct attack on Alamut, concentrating on securing his
            position against rivals, including his half-brother Muhammad I
            Tapar, who eventually settled for a smaller role, becoming malik
            (translated as "king") in Armenia and Azerbaijan.
          </p>
          <p class="map-paragraph">
            The first notable assassination was that of powerful Seljuk vizier
            Nizam al-Mulk in 1092, who had helped propel Barkiyaruq to lead the
            sultanate. Sabbah is reputed to have remarked, "the killing of this
            devil is the beginning of bliss" on hearing to the death of Nizam.
            Of the 50 assassinations conducted during Sabbah's reign, more than
            half were Seljuk officials, many of whom supported Muhammad I Tapar.
            The story (presented here) claiming a friendship among Nizam
            al-Mulk, Hassan-i Sabbah and Omar Khayyam described by Edward
            FitzGerald in his translation of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is
            most certainly false.
          </p>
          <p class="map-paragraph">
            The Assassins seized Persian castles of Rudkhan and Gerdkuh in 1096,
            before turning to Syria. Gerdkuh was re-fortified by Mu'ayyad al-Din
            Muzaffar ibn Ahmad Mustawfi, a Seljuk who was a secret Isma'ili
            convert, and his son Sharaf al-Din Muhammad. There they occupied the
            fortress at Shaizar held by the Banu Munqidh, using it to spread
            terror to Isfahan, the heart of the Seljuk Empire. A rebellion by
            the local population drove the Assassins out, but they continued to
            occupy a smaller fortress at Khalinjan. In 1097, Barkiyaruq
            associate Bursuq was killed by Assassins.
          </p>
          <p class="map-paragraph">
            By 1100, Barkiyaruq had consolidated his power, and the Assassins
            increased their presence by infiltrating the sultan's court and
            army. Day-to-day functions of the court were frequently performed
            while armored and with weapons. The next year, he tasked his brother
            Ahmad Sanjar, then ruler of Khorasan, to attack Assassin strongholds
            in Quhistan. The siege at Tabas was at first successful, with the
            walls of the fortress breached, but then was lifted, possibly
            because the Seljuk commander had been bribed. The subsequent attack
            was devastating to the Assassins, but the terms granted were
            generous and they were soon reestablished at both Quhistan and
            Tabas. In the years following, the Assassins continued their mission
            against religious and secular leaders. Given these successes, they
            began expanding their operations into Syria.
